# Pretraining Language Model with Corpus and Evaluation Tasks

## 1. Corpus

### 1.1 Diverse Text Data
- **Specialized Literature**: CNN/DailyMail, BookCorpus, Wikipedia

### 1.2 Question-Answer Datasets
- **Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-Blank Questions**: RACE, ARC, and MCTest
- **Reading Comprehension**: SQuAD, CMRC

### 1.3 Summarization and Text Generation Data
- **Summarization Datasets**: LCSTS, Gigaword, XSum
- **Dialogue Datasets**: Persona-Chat, DailyDialog, OpenSubtitles
- 
### 1.4 Mathematical Problem Solving Data
- **Mathematical Question Bank**: Math23K, MathQA

## 2. Evaluation Task Recommendations

### 2.1 Multiple Choice Questions
- **Task**: Provide the model with multiple-choice questions and let it choose the correct answer.
- **Evaluation**: Calculate the model's accuracy across different difficulties and subjects.

### 2.2 Fill-in-the-Blank Questions
- **Task**: Provide sentences or paragraphs with missing parts and ask the model to fill in the blanks.
- **Evaluation**: Compare the content generated by the model with the standard answers.

### 2.3 Text Summarization
- **Task**: Given a long text, ask the model to generate a short summary.
- **Evaluation**: Use metrics such as ROUGE to evaluate the similarity between the generated summary and reference summaries.

### 2.4 Text Generation
- **Task**: Provide a topic or starting sentence and ask the model to generate continuous text.
- **Evaluation**: Manually evaluate the coherence, richness, and creativity of the generated text.

### 2.5 Mathematical Problem Solving
- **Task**: Provide mathematical problems and let the model generate the solution steps and the final answer.
- **Evaluation**: Check the correctness of the answer and the rationality of the problem-solving steps.

### 2.6 Natural Language Inference
- **Task**: Use inference datasets (such as SNLI, MNLI) to evaluate the model's logical reasoning abilities.
- **Evaluation**: Calculate the model's accuracy in determining the logical relationships between sentences.
